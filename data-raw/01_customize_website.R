# Add About Page
#
# WQdasbhoard includes several customizable pages, including the "About" and
# "Download" pages. Before running this script, go to the folder "inst/app/www"
# and update the following files: "About.qmd", "Download.qmd", and "_brand.yml"
#
# "About.qmd" lets you update the "About" page and "Download.qmd" lets you
# update the "Download" page. Both of these files can be updated in visual
# mode. Images and tables are supported. "Download.qmd" contains some light
# code to dynamically update the organization name and latest year updated;
# feel free to replace these elements with static text.
#
# If you make any changes to "About.qmd" or "Download.qmd", you must rerun this
# script to update the site.
#
# DO NOT CHANGE THE HEADER FOR EITHER QMD FILE. (format, engine, brand, params)
#
# "_brand.yml" lets you set the appearance of the site. At minimum, you MUST
# change meta > name to the name of your organization. meta > title sets the
# title for the website. The remaining elements set the color palette and font
# for the website. You can find more information on what _brand.yml is and what
# it does here:
# https://posit-dev.github.io/brand-yml/
#
# To run this script, hit CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER
